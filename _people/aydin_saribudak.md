I am a PhD student at Rutgers ECE Department and a research assistant at Radical Lab. I am studying on high throughput computing for ensemble-based applications and to analyze complex biomolecular interactions under the supervision of Prof. Shantenu Jha.

I earned M. Phil and M.Eng degrees from CUNY City College in 2017 and my B.S. degree from Middle East Technical University in 2005, all in Electrical Engineering. At CUNY City College, I worked on AI methods to compute personalized disease progression and drug efficacy analysis.

Prior to become a PhD student and research assistant at Radical Lab, I took practical trainings; the first one was for a Sr. Data Scientist position at Neustar, Inc. for one and a half year, and the second one was at UVa Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Dept. as a Computational Biologist from March to July, 2019. I have joined Radical Lab in August 2019. While doing research at Radical Lab during my PhD education, I will be also employed as a Teaching and Graduate Assistant at Rutgers ECE Department.
